AI-Powered Data Entry Agent.

This project is an **AI-powered data entry agent** that:
1. Converts **MP3 audio files** to text using speech recognition.
2. Checks and corrects **grammar and spelling mistakes** in the transcribed text.
3. Saves the corrected text into an **Excel file**.

---

Features.
- **Speech-to-Text**: Converts MP3 audio files to text using Google Speech-to-Text.
- **Grammar Checking**: Corrects grammar and spelling mistakes using LanguageTool.
- **Data Export**: Saves the corrected text into an Excel file.
- **Batch Processing**: Can process multiple MP3 files in a folder.
- **User Interface**: Optional web interface using Streamlit.

Usage

Step 1: Prepare Your Audio Files
1. Place your MP3 files in the `audio/` folder.
   - Example: `audio/test_audio.mp3`

Step 2: Run the Script
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. The script will:
   - Convert the MP3 file to text.
   - Correct grammar and spelling mistakes.
   - Save the corrected text into an Excel file in the `output/` folder.

Step 3: Check the Output
1. Open the `output/` folder to find the Excel file (e.g., `output.xlsx`).
2. The Excel file will contain the corrected text.

---

Optional: Streamlit Web Interface
If you want to use the Streamlit web interface:
1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```
2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.
3. Upload an MP3 file and see the results in real-time.

Folder Structure
Hereâ€™s the folder structure of the project:
```
data-entry-agent/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ audio/                  # Folder for audio files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_audio.mp3      # Sample MP3 file for testing
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ output/                 # Folder for output files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ output.xlsx         # Output Excel file (will be created by the script)
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                 # Main Python script
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt        # File listing dependencies
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ README.md               # This file
```

Troubleshooting
1. File Not Found Error:
   - Ensure the `audio/` folder exists and contains the MP3 file.
   - Double-check the file path in the script.

2. FFmpeg Not Installed:
   - Install FFmpeg using the instructions above.

3. Streamlit Not Working:
   - Ensure Streamlit is installed: `pip install streamlit`.
   - Check for port conflicts (default port is 8501).
